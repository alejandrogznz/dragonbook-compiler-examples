1.1.2 What are the advantages of (a) a compiler over and interpreter (b) an interpreter over a compiler

---- a speed advantage over the interpreter.
---- (b) An interpreter may give a better error diagnostic as each line in the source is executed statement by statement

1.1.3 What advantages are there to a  language-processing system in which the compiler produces assembly language rather than machine language?
